# Simple socket chat app
As of now you are able to get the server running on one machine (say your PC) and the client on another machine (say your laptop). Only drawbacks are they both have to be running Windows and have to be connected to the same network. 

It uses WinSock2 for sockets and I'm writing it in C++14.
